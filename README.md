### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey my name is Silas and I am happy to welcome you on my site.</br>
I studied civil engineering at the Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences, the Universidad de JaÃ©n and the University of Stuttgart. Currently I work as an academic assistant in research and teaching at the Institute for Lightweight Structures and Conceptual Design at the University of Stuttgart. </br>
I really enjoy working with students and having the opportunity to constantly face new critical questions.
